    "Kaggle's API limit for Google Football is yet to be made explicit but in Kaggle Halite the limit of 1000 requests per day was eventually raised to 3600 requests per day max.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate limits are shared between the ListEpisodes and GetEpisodeReplay endpoints. Exceeding limits repeatedly will lead to temporary and then permanent bans. At some point it is expected Kaggle will remove this public API and provide datasets of episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The episodes take a lot of space. In Kaggle Halite, I ended up with 200GB of games. The Football JSON files are **ten times larger** so you may end up with terabytes. If you use this or any scraper, consider posting the dataset to Kaggle Datasets for others to use."
